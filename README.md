# voting_app

A simple website which takes "name" and "password" from the user verifies it and shows the user's details on the next screen for manual verification.
Once verified the app asks the user to vote the candidate of his/her choice.
Once the vote has been cast, the database updates the attribute "vote" corrsponding to the candidate against whom the vote has been casted.

The project was made using Twig, css, javascript for Front-end NodeJs, ExpressJs for Back-end and mongoDb for database.
